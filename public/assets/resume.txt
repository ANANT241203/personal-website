I enjoy building practical machine learning systems that solve clear problems and improve existing workflows.
Currently, Iâ€™m developing tools and products that connect the ability of large language models with everyday platforms
to make information easier to access and use.
Work Experience

AI Engineer
GPT Integrators | Atlanta, Georgia, United States
-
Architected comprehensive full-stack Agentic AI assistant using React/TypeScript, Node.js/Express,
PostgreSQL/pgvector for semantic search, OpenAI RAG implementation, enterprise multi-platform OAuth integrations
(Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint), Docker containerization, and scalable modular microservices architecture
achieving 50% cost optimization through intelligent batch processing.
Integrated OpenAI GPT models to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat system enabling natural
language queries across synchronized documents with context-aware responses.
Developed intelligent document processing pipeline supporting 10+ file formats (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, Excel,
Google Docs) with automated content extraction and vector embedding generation.
Implemented semantic search functionality using vector embeddings and pgvector, enabling AI-powered document
discovery and content matching.
Architected and developed a comprehensive document AI assistant web application using React 18/TypeScript
frontend with Node.js/Express backend, featuring modular service architecture with 15+ specialized microservices.
Implemented multi-platform integration system supporting Google Drive, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and Notion
APIs with OAuth 2.0 authentication and secure credential management.
Designed and built PostgreSQL database with pgvector extension for semantic search capabilities and implemented
Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations.
Implemented Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced AI tool integration and function calling
capabilities.
Containerized application using Docker with multi-service orchestration via Docker Compose for development,
staging, and production environments.
Designed modular service architecture breaking down monolithic services into focused, testable modules (reduced
individual service complexity from 1,900+ lines to ~300 lines per module).
Implemented intelligent batch processing for document embeddings achieving 50% cost reduction through
optimized OpenAI API usage and smart real-time vs. batch processing decisions.
Developed responsive React application using shadcn/ui component library, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript with
modern state management via TanStack Query.
Implemented end-to-end encryption for sensitive credentials and API tokens with secure key management and
environment-based configuration.
Designed comprehensive session management using PostgreSQL-backed sessions with Redis caching for highperformance
user state management.
Led cross-functional coordination between ML, backend, and frontend teams to architect unified system interfaces,
ensuring seamless integration of AI pipelines, scalable microservices, and OAuth-based enterprise integrations
across multiple platforms.

Core Skills
Machine Learning Researcher
The Research World (Threws)
-
Developed machine learning models that improved diagnostic accuracy from 78% to 94% in medical imaging
applications, significantly enhancing early disease detection. Published research findings in SCOPUS-indexed journals,
collaborating with experts to refine methodologies for large-scale medical data analysis.
Published 7 peer-reviewed papers in Springer CCIS, SCOPUS-indexed journals, and Auerbach Publications on AI
applications in medical diagnostics, sustainability optimization, and cyber-physical system security.
Developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and Keras for medical image classification (X-ray,
MRI, peripheral blood smears), improving diagnostic accuracy from 78% to 94%.
Engineered preprocessing pipelines using OpenCV and scikit-image for histogram equalization, noise reduction,
contrast enhancement, and ROI extraction across 50,000+ patient images.
Implemented hyperparameter optimization using Optuna to fine-tune model architectures (learning rate schedules,
dropout rates, batch sizes) across GPU-accelerated multi-node training clusters.
Integrated ensemble stacking of CNNs, SVMs, and Random Forest classifiers to stabilize predictions across diverse
diagnostic categories and unbalanced class distributions.
Applied advanced data augmentation (elastic deformation, rotation, scaling, translation) to increase model
robustness for minority-class disease patterns.
Designed scalable end-to-end ML pipelines using TensorFlow Extended (TFX) for preprocessing, training, validation,
and deployment across large-scale datasets exceeding 100GB.

Data Scientist (Sales & Digital Media)
Ultrafast Tools | India
-
Worked on data-driven strategies to enhance customer engagement and optimize digital marketing efforts. Developed
predictive models that increased customer retention from 65% to 80% and reduced fraudulent transactions from
10,000 cases per month to under 1,000, significantly improving financial security.
Built customer churn prediction models using XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost on 5M+ customer interaction
records, improving retention from 65% to 80%.
Developed real-time fraud detection algorithms using isolation forests, unsupervised clustering (DBSCAN), and
supervised binary classifiers (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to reduce fraud from 10,000 to under 1,000
monthly flagged cases.
Engineered large-scale ETL pipelines using Apache Airflow, Pandas, and PySpark to ingest and process 20GB+ of daily
transactional and marketing data streams.
Designed and implemented ad conversion optimization models using multi-touch attribution, Bayesian uplift
modeling, and causal inference, driving 25% lift in conversion and 40% reduction in ad spend inefficiency.
Deployed time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to optimize logistics, reduce delivery delays from 5
days to 2 days, and balance inventory across regional distribution hubs.
Integrated data pipelines into production APIs using FastAPI and Docker for real-time fraud scoring and personalized
ad recommendations.
Built interactive analytics dashboards in Tableau and custom Flask-based web apps for real-time sales, marketing,
and fraud metrics monitoring.
